# Jet Reconstruction Visualisation Examples

## `visualise-jets.jl`

This script will produce a PNG/PDF showing the results of a jet reconstruction.
This is a 3D plot where all the initial energy deposits are visualised, with
colours that indicate in which final cluster the deposit ended up in.

## `visualise-jets.ipynb`

This notebook will produce a visualisation of jet reconstruction in the browser.
This is a 3D plot where all the initial energy deposits are visualised, with
colours that indicate in which final cluster the deposit ended up in.

## `visualise-jets-nb.ipynb`

The same as the above example, but using a Pluto notebook.

## `animate-reconstruction.jl`
