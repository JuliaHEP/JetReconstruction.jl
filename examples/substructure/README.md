# Examples for Substructure Modules

The `jet-grooming.jl` file shows the usage of `jet_filtering` and `jet_trimming` functions while the `jet-tagging.jl` file demonstrates how to use `mass_drop` and `soft_drop` functions.

To use these examples run

```julia
julia --project jet-tagging.jl
...
julia --project jet-grooming.jl
...
```

The parameters of tagging and grooming and the input files can be easily changed in the scripts.
