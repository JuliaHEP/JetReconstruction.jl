# Jet Substructure

Jet substructure techniques provide powerful tools for analyzing and refining the properties of jets. Below are some of the key jet substructure functions, that are available.

### Mass Drop Tagging

```julia
mass_drop(jet::PseudoJet, clusterseq::ClusterSequence, tag::MassDropTagger) -> PseudoJet
```

The [mass_drop](@ref) function identifies subjets in a jet that pass the mass drop tagging condition. To use the `mass_drop` function:

- Configure the [MassDropTagger](@ref) with parameters tailored to the expected mass drop and distance thresholds for analysis.

```julia
tagger = MassDropTagger(mu=0.67, y=0.09)
```

- Apply the `mass_drop` function to the jet and its clustering sequence.

```julia
tagged_jet = mass_drop(jet, clusterseq, tagger)
```

- If the jet is tagged successfully, the function returns the identified subjet. Else it returns `PseudoJet(0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0)`.

### Soft Drop Tagging

```julia
soft_drop(jet::PseudoJet, clusterseq::ClusterSequence, tag::SoftDropTagger) -> PseudoJet
```

The [soft_drop](@ref) function applies soft-drop grooming to remove soft, wide-angle radiation from jets. It reclusters the jet with a specified radius and clustering method, iteratively checking the soft-drop condition on subjets. To use the `soft_drop` function:

- Construct the [SoftDropTagger](@ref) by defining the parameters for the grooming process, such as the energy fraction (`zcut`) and angular exponent (`b`)

```julia
tagger = SoftDropTagger(zcut=0.1, b=2.0)
```

By default, the reclustering radius is set to `1.0` which can be modified by defing the `tagger` object as

```julia
tagger = SoftDropTagger(zcut=0.1, b=2.0, cluster_rad=0.4)
```

- Apply the `soft_drop` function to the jet and its clustering sequence.

```julia
tagged_jet = soft_drop(jet, clusterseq, tagger)
```

- If the jet is tagged successfully, the function returns the identified subjet. Else it returns `nothing`.

### Jet Filtering

```julia
jet_filtering(jet::PseudoJet, clusterseq::ClusterSequence, filter::JetFilter) -> PseudoJet
```

The [jet_filtering](@ref) function filters a jet to retain only the hardest subjets based on a specified radius and number. To use the function:

- Set the radius for subjet clustering and the number of hardest subjets to retain in a [JetFilter](@ref) method.

```julia
filter = JetFilter(filter_radius=0.3, num_hardest_jets=3)
```

- Apply the `jet_filtering` function to refine the jet.

```julia
filtered_jet = jet_filtering(jet, clusterseq, filter)
```

- The function returns the filtered jet that retains only the most significant subjets, reducing noise.

### Jet Trimming

```julia
jet_trimming(jet::PseudoJet, clusterseq::ClusterSequence, trim::JetTrim) -> PseudoJet
```

The [jet_trimming](@ref) function trims a jet by removing subjets with transverse momentum below a specified fraction of the main jet's momentum. This method cleans up jets by removing soft particles. To use this function:

- Configure the trimming radius and momentum fraction threshold in [JetTrim](@ref)

```julia
trim = JetTrim(trim_radius=0.3, trim_fraction=0.3, recluster_method=JetAlgorithm.CA)
```

It is to be noted that the `jet_trimming` function reclusters the constituents of the jet using either `C/A` or `kT ` algorithm, which needs to be specified.

- Apply the `jet_trimming` function to clean the jet.

```julia
trimmed_jet = jet_trimming(jet, clusterseq, trim)
```

- The function returns the trimmed jet.
