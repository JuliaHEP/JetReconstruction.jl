# Jet Helper Functions

These functions are provided as a convenient way to work with the results of jet
reconstruction.

- [`pt_fraction`](@ref)

Returns the transverse momentum fraction in the softer of the two jets.

- [`kt_scale`](@ref)

Returns the transverse momentum scale between two jets, the product of the
smaller ``p_T`` and the angular separation in the the η-ϕ plane.
