    jet_reconstruct(particles; p = -1, algorithm = nothing, R = 1.0, recombine = +, strategy = RecoStrategy.Best)

Reconstructs jets from a collection of particles using a specified algorithm and
strategy

# Arguments
- `particles`: A collection of particles used for jet reconstruction. 
- `p::Union{Real, Nothing} = -1`: The power value used for the distance measure
  for generalised k_T, which maps to a particular reconstruction algorithm (-1 =
  AntiKt, 0 = Cambridge/Aachen, 1 = Kt).
- `algorithm::Union{JetAlgorithm.Algorithm, Nothing} = nothing`: The algorithm
  to use for jet reconstruction.
- `R=1.0`: The jet radius parameter.
- `recombine=+`: The recombination scheme used for combining particles.
- `strategy=RecoStrategy.Best`: The jet reconstruction strategy to use.
  `RecoStrategy.Best` makes a dynamic decision based on the number of starting
  particles.

# Returns
A cluster sequence object containing the reconstructed jets and the merging
history.

# Details

## `particles` argument
Any type that supplies the methods `pt2()`, `phi()`, `rapidity()`, `px()`,
`py()`, `pz()`, `energy()` (in the `JetReconstruction` namespace) can be used.
This includes `LorentzVector`, `LorentzVectorCyl`, and `PseudoJet`, for which
these methods are already predefined in the `JetReconstruction` namespace.

## `recombine` argument
The `recombine` argument is the function used to merge pairs of particles. The
default is simply `+(jet1,jet2)`, i.e. 4-momenta addition or the *E*-scheme.

## Consistency of `p`, `algorithm` and `R` arguments
If an algorithm is explicitly specified the `p` value should be consistent with
it or `nothing`. If the algorithm is one where `p` can vary, then it has to be
given, along with the algorithm.

If the `p` parameter is passed and `algorithm=nothing`, then pp-type
reconstruction is implied (i.e., AntiKt, CA, Kt or GenKt will be used,
depending on the value of `p`).

When an algorithm has no `R` dependence the `R` parameter is ignored.

# Example
```julia
jet_reconstruct(particles; p = -1, R = 0.4)
jet_reconstruct(particles; algorithm = JetAlgorithm.Kt, R = 1.0)
jet_reconstruct(particles; algorithm = JetAlgorithm.Durham)
jet_reconstruct(particles; algorithm = JetAlgorithm.GenKt, p = 0.5, R = 1.0)
```
