# Code of Conduct

We ask all contributors to `JetReconstruction.jl` to follow the [Julia Community
Standards](https://julialang.org/community/standards/) - thank you!

Should there be any perceived violation of the Code Of Conduct then please
contact the conveners of the [HSF JuliaHEP
Organisation](https://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/activities/juliahep.html) who
will investigate and take action appropriately, following the same guidelines
as the [Julia Community Stewards](https://julialang.org/community/stewards/).
